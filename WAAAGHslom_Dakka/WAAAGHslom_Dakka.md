# WAAAGHslom Dakka — Beakie Killer and the Warp Squigosaurs

> Space Marines in the forty-first millenia, their very existence is an abomination. Encased in their ceramite shells, driven by the unrelenting hubris of their emperor, their singular mission is domination of the galaxy.

WAAAGHslom Dakka is a brutal Ork Warboss who is dedicated to the destruction of all umie beakies. His original name is lost to Ork history. Exiled by none other than Ghazghkull Thraka for his abnormal obsession with hair squigs, he was jettisoned from an Ork ulk in the Warp. By the fortune of Gork—or Mork—he fell from the Warp onto Zamaz, the home world of the Astral Drakes Space Marines chapter. In a brutal guerilla campaign, he stalked the Astral Drakes on Zamaz, taking them down in small groups.

Weeks later the ulks, rocks, and battle moon of Ghazghkull's WAAAGH!! reached Zamaz. While Ghazghkull is credited with the destruction of the Astral Drakes, it is actually WAAAGHslom Dakka who killed at least six hundred Space Marines before the other Orks joined him in the battle. It is on Zamaz that WAAAGHslom Dakka earned his name and his maniacal enthusiasm for cutting into ceramite armour with his chainsword. Although, he still appreciates a good hair squig.

## Rules

The rules for WAAAGHslom Dakka are presented as restrictions on an Ork Warboss and Ork army constuction, as such they should be legal in any environment that uses the standard rules from _Codex: Orks_. The restrictions described below do not supersede any other rules. For example, WAAAGHslom Dakka must take a warlord trait that would prevent him from ever appearing in an army with Ghazghkull Thraka, because each warlord trait can be assigned only once per army. 

### WAAAGHslom Dakka — Beakie Killer

- WAAGHslom Dakka is an Ork **Warboss**.
- WAAAGHslom Dakka has **1 kustom shoota** in place of the ~~kombi-rokkit~~, keeps the **big choppa**, and may _not_ have an ~~attack squig~~.
- WAAAGHslom Dakka may only join a **Goff** detachment.
- WAAAGHslom Dakka _must_ be assigned the **Proper Killy** warlord trait and the **Headwoppa's Killchoppa** relic. If WAAAGHslom Dakka is not the Warlord, you must pay the CP for **Big Boss** to make WAAAGHslom Dakka **Proper Killy**.
- WAAAGHslom Dakka _may not_ be the Warlord unless the army consists entirely of a **single patrol detachment** that includes _all_ of the **Warp Squigosaurs**.
- **Luggub Gubinzes**: Any army that includes WAAAGHslom Dakka _must_ also include a **Goff** **Character** unit with the **Big Mek** or **Mek** keywords. This is Luggub Gubinzes, a Mek who is obsessed with beakie technology. He follows WAAAGHslom Dakka around for the trail of beakie bits left in his wake.

### The Warp Squigosaurs

WAAAGHslom Dakka is frequently joined by a band of **Goff** Orks, known as the Warp Squigosaurs. If you include **Skaranda**, **Mor Smashateefa**, or **Garga** in your army, you _must_ include the other two from that list. **Dakka Boyz** and **Kill Wagon** may be taken separately. You only need to take all five units in the Warp Squigosaurs in an army if WAAAGHslom Dakka is the Warlord (see rules above). Pay the additional points when including any "_may_" options in an army. The options are included to make it easier to build armies to specific points values.

- **Dakka Boyz**: 10 Beast Snagga Boyz which _may_ include 1 thump gun
- **Skaranda**: Pain Boy _without_ a ~~grot orderly~~
- **Mor Smashateefa**: Nob on Smasha Squig
- **Garga** and his Gitz: 5 Flash Gitz and the kaptin, Garga, __has__ 1 gitfinda squig. The unit _may_ have 1 ammo runt.
- **Kill Wagon**: Battlewagon with 1 kannon, 1 lobba, 3 big shootas, 'ard case, and the Fortress on Wheels kustom job

### WAAAGHslom Dakka — Meta Filler

The most obvious archetype in the meta for WAAAGHslom Dakka is Goff Pressure. He drops into the Warboss slot in one of the patrols, although he's probably replacing a Beastboss, because he's only ever going to be a specialist at killing beakies. WAAAGHslom Dakka is not a Trukk Boy. WAAAGHslom Dakka can also lead a small Goff patrol in a Freebooterz army list to provide more of the melee tools. If you're experimenting with Goff and Blood Axe builds, WAAAGHslom could be an interesting Goff Warboss.
